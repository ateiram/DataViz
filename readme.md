### Bike Sharing in Boston

####Background

A bicycle-sharing system, or public bike share(PBS) scheme,is a shared transport service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Bluebikesis Metro Boston's public bike share program,with more than 1,800 bikes at over 200stations. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips.

#### Motivation
Answering questions like where do bike riders ride? When do they ride? How far do they go?Which stations are most popular? Who are the bikers?.. and more can lead to an improvedservice and better understanding of needs

#### Data

The dataset includes:
- Trip Duration (seconds) (Continuous)
- Start Time and Date  (DateTime)
- Stop Time and Date (DateTime)
- Start Station Name & ID (Categorical)
- End Station Name & ID (Categorical)
- Bike ID (Categorical)
- User Type (Casual = Single Trip or Day Pass user;Member = Annual or MonthlyMember) (Categorical)
- Birth Year  (Categorical)
- Gender, self-reported by member (Zero=unknown; 1=male;2=female) (Categorical)
- Start station latitude and longitude (geospatial)
- End station latitude and longitude (geospatial)


####Outcomes
Expected impacts and benefits of the proposed project will be the valuable insights taken from the visualizations and EDA. Having insights on mobilitypatterns, speed, travel time & roadnetwork performance from the local bike-sharing programs(and/or Taxi apps) will give an opportunity of further study of urban road traffic and infrastructure adjustments
